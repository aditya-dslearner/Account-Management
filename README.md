This C++ project implements a simple Bank Account Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It allows users to create accounts (savings or checking), deposit, withdraw, transfer money, and view account details. Accounts are stored in a vector, and polymorphism is used to manage different account types, ensuring modularity and extensibility.

Key Features:-
Create Account: Create a new account with a name and initial balance.
Deposit: Deposit money into the account.
Withdraw: Withdraw money from the account.
Check Balance: Check the current balance of the account.
Account Details: View account holder details (name, balance).
Transfer: Transfer money between accounts.
